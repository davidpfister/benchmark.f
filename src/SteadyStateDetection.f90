!! <h2>Remarks</h2>
!! The steady-state detection algorithm is based on the work by 
!! J. D. Kelly and J. D. Hedengren, “A steady-state detection (SSD) 
!! algorithm to detect non-stationary drifts in processes,” 
!! J. Process Control, vol. 23, no. 3, pp. 326–331, 2013.
!! The original algorithm has been altered to be used with dynamic real-time 
!! data.

    !> @brief Compute the probability that a sample `x` reached steady-state.
    !!        The SSD algorithm presented in this work is also window-based and utilizes the
    !!        Student-t test to determine if the difference between the process signal value 
    !!        minus its mean is above or below the standard-deviation times its statistical critical value. If less
    !!        than, then that time instant or point is steady and if greater than, then it is unsteady
    !!        where the aggregation is computed over the window approximating a probability or
    !!        frequency of being at steady-state. 
    !! @param[in] x Sample of real(r8) values
    !! @param[in] offset Index of the first values inside the periodic array x
    !! @param[in] alpha Significance level for the student test.
    !! 
    !! The mean is defined as:
    !! @f[
    !! \mu = \frac{1}{n}\left(\sum x-m\sum i\right)
    !! @f]
    !! where @f$m@f$ is the slope of a linear drift. In the present case, @f$m=0@f$
    !! It comes that the standard deviation is given by 
    !! @f[
    !! \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-2}\sum (x-\mu)^2}
    !! @f]
    !! At this point along with a specified Student-t critical or threshold value at a particu100 lar significance level α and degrees-of-freedom n, all of the necessary information is
    !! available to test the null-hypothesis that the process signal is steady or is stationary
    !! about @f$\mu@f$
    !! @f[
    !! if\  x - \mu < t_{crit}-\sigma\ , then\  1,\  else\  0
    !! @f]
    !! @f$t_{crit}@f$ is evaluated for a given significance level and a given degree of freedom
    !! using the t-distribution.
